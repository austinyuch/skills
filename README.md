# aclab Skills

**aclab's** curated collection of AI agent skills for professional software development workflows.
This is an **agent-agnostic** collection — the skills run on **OpenCode**, **Claude Code**, and
**Codex** (and other compatible runtimes), not just one vendor.

🌐 **Languages:** [English](README.md) · [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

> 🤖 **Using a coding agent?** Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — it explains how to navigate this
> collection, when to enter the **Spec Master Method**, and the routing/ownership rules the skills expect.

## Quick Start

Install the skills into your coding agent. **Nothing is published to any registry** — every command
below resolves straight from this Git repo. Pick whichever runtime you already have.

`<agent>` = `opencode` | `claude` | `codex` | `kiro` (default: `opencode`).

**Node — npx / bunx (no clone):**
```bash
npx -y github:austinyuch/skills claude
bunx   github:austinyuch/skills codex
```

**Python — uvx / pipx (no clone):**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/austinyuch/skills aclab-skills claude
pipx run --spec git+https://github.com/austinyuch/skills aclab-skills codex
```

**No Node/Python — clone + run a script (cross-platform):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/austinyuch/skills.git && cd skills
bash scripts/install.sh claude       # macOS / Linux
pwsh scripts/install.ps1 claude      # Windows PowerShell
```

Each skill installs as `<skill-home>/<skill-name>/` and the agent picks it up automatically.
Override the destination anywhere with `SKILLS_TARGET=/custom/path`. (OpenCode users can also use the
community tool: `npx skills@latest add austinyuch/skills`.)

### Native binaries (GitHub Releases, not in git)

A few skills rely on **prebuilt native binaries / models that are intentionally not committed** here —
they are large and platform-specific, so they are gitignored. This keeps `git clone`, `npx`, and `uvx`
fast and **LFS-free** (no git-lfs dependency, no pointer-stub breakage). They are distributed via
**GitHub Releases, never git LFS.**

- **`code-review`** uses a `review-cli-<os>-<arch>` binary (+ a ~128 MB embedding model). Installing it
  copies the skill's docs/scripts but **not** the binary. Fetch the matching binary with `--with-cli`:

  ```bash
  npx -y github:austinyuch/skills claude --with-cli
  uvx --from git+https://github.com/austinyuch/skills aclab-skills claude --with-cli
  bash scripts/install.sh claude --with-cli       #   macOS / Linux
  pwsh scripts/install.ps1 claude -WithCli         #   Windows
  ```

  The pure-Python review helpers — `code-refactoring-advisor`, `test-quality-reviewer`,
  `security-risk-reviewer`, `test-design-generator` — work as-is with no binary. The model is not
  fetched (the CLI runs graph-only without it).

> 🔐 **This repository is private.** `npx`/`uvx`/`git clone` **and** the `--with-cli` binary download
> all require GitHub authentication. `--with-cli` uses the **`gh` CLI** (`gh auth login`) to pull the
> asset from the [`review-cli-v0.11.0`](https://github.com/austinyuch/skills/releases/tag/review-cli-v0.11.0)
> release; without `gh` it prints the exact `gh release download …` command to run. Anonymous/public
> install is not available unless the repo (or release) is made public.

## The Spec Master Method

> **Bring DevSecOps, Scrum, and TDD into agentic workflows — without losing the truth.**
> 把 DevSecOps、Scrum 與 TDD 帶進 agentic 工作流——而且不失真。

Coding agents made *producing* code cheap but not *coordinating* it. The bottleneck moves from
typing to deciding ownership, keeping evidence fresh, and stopping a green-looking file from lying
about readiness. The **Spec Master Method** is an open-source family of **14 composable skills** that
ports five proven engineering practices into a governed, inspectable agentic workflow.

| Classic practice | Job it still does | Owner skill |
|---|---|---|
| Spec-Driven Development (SDD) | Vague intent → traceable delivery | `spec-driven-development` (inspired by [AWS Kiro](https://kiro.dev)) |
| Test-Driven Development (TDD) | Pin behavior before code changes | `tdd-workflow` + `test-design-generator` |
| Domain-Driven Design (DDD) | Align boundaries with business language | SDD Phase 2 (bounded contexts) |
| Test management | Green CI → auditable risk evidence | `test-registry-manager` + `test-quality-reviewer` |
| Refactoring | Lower cost of change after behavior is protected | `code-refactoring-advisor` |

The 14 skills sit in three layers:

- **Govern & route** — `spec-master` (front door), `spec-registry-manager`, `issue-log-manager`, `local-infra-registry-governance`, `shared-governance`
- **Deliver** — `spec-driven-development` (6-phase lifecycle), `tdd-workflow`, `test-registry-manager`, `test-design-generator`
- **Verify (left-shift)** — `code-review`, `code-refactoring-advisor`, `test-quality-reviewer`, `security-risk-reviewer`, `sonarqube-bridge`

The core anti-false-green rule: **evidence flows one way** — `ISSUE_LOG → spec artifacts → folder-level TESTS.md → workspace rollup → RTM.md → SPECS.md` — and derived summaries never sync back into upstream truth.
